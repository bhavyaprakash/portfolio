            <p>
                I am a passionate Software Developer with <strong>3 years of experience</strong> in designing and building web applications. 
                My expertise spans across <strong>Angular, React</strong>, and <strong>Java Spring Boot</strong>, allowing me to create seamless 
                front-end interfaces while integrating them with powerful backend services. I thrive on developing clean, efficient, 
                and scalable solutions that enhance user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from enterprise applications to interactive web platforms. 
                I enjoy tackling complex challenges, optimizing performance, and implementing best practices to ensure maintainable and 
                high-quality code. My experience in both frontend and backend development enables me to bridge the gap between UI/UX and 
                server-side functionality effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest technologies. Whether it's exploring new frameworks, improving 
                application architecture, or refining development workflows, I am committed to continuous improvement. Collaboration is key 
                to my approach, and I enjoy working in dynamic teams to create impactful software solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond coding, I take pride in writing clean documentation, mentoring junior developers, and contributing to discussions that 
                drive innovation. My goal is to build products that not only meet technical requirements but also deliver value to users 
                and businesses alike.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m always open to new opportunities—don’t hesitate to get in touch!
